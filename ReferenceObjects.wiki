= Reference Objects =

A reference object refers to a class that is implemented in such a way that all
instances with the same value share properties. Thus changes to one instance of
an object representing a user should also show up in another object representing
the same user. Reference objects are mutable, in that their state can be changed
without creating a new object.

Flourish includes a few different classes that are reference objects:

 - fActiveRecord
 - fDirectory
 - fFile
 - fImage

Here is another page with some info about reference objects:

The opposite of a reference object is a [/docs/ValueObjects value object].
