= Roadmap =

This page outlines the currently planned changes for Flourish. Right now the
project is in beta, with the development focus being on stabilizing the API.
Most of the remaining work before it becomes stable is related to:

 - changing existing APIs to be more user friendly
 - removing functionality that deals too much with HTML generation, or making
   it more flexible
 - refactoring existing code into different classes

The current issues include many of
the remaining items, but not all tickets will be completed by the time the
project becomes stable. At the current pace I expect the stable release to
happen by late 2012.

''Please note that Flourish has undergone a good deal of real-world testing,
and can generally be considered production ready.''
