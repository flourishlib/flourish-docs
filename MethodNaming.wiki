= Method Naming =

Flourish uses some standards in method names to help developers easily identify
functionality without having to review the documentation. Below is a list of
verbs and their connotations in Flourish code:

 - '''add:''' assigns a value that allows multiple
 - '''check:''' returns a boolean
 - '''enable:''' turn a feature on (or possibly off)
 - '''encode:''' returns a value that is safe for output into the appropriate
   format
 - '''extend:''' add functionality to a class
 - '''get:''' returns a value
 - '''is:''' returns a boolean
 - '''prepare:''' returns a value that is safe for output into HTML, should
   only be used with trusted content
 - '''print:''' echoes content
 - '''register:''' adds or sets a callback for a hook
 - '''set:''' assigns a value
 - '''show:''' conditionally echoes content
 - '''validate:''' throws an exception if something is not correct

The Flourish ORM also has a few conventions for method names:

 - '''build:''' returns an fRecordSet
 - '''configure:''' adds functionality to a specific class or column
 - '''count:''' returns the number of records in an fRecordSet
 - '''create:''' returns a single fActiveRecord
 - '''populate:''' uses values from the HTTP request to set values in one or
   more objects
