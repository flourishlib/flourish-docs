Public methods flagged with the PHPDoc tag `@internal` and all protected methods
and attributes are considered internal to Flourish and are subject to change
even in minor revisions or during the beta. Below is a list of changes that
affect internal code.

Normally this list will only be applicable if you write ORM plugins or mess
around with the ORM internals.
