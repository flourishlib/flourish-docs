= Motivations for Flourish =
<<toc>>

Before work on Flourish began, a good deal of time was spent trying to find a
PHP framework or library that accomplished the following:

 - Does not require use of
   [http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/modelViewController.html MVC],
   especially the [http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/frontController.html
   Front Controller] variation
 - Has good documentation that allows finding what you want with minimal effort
 - Handles OS/server portability well, requiring a minimum of non-standard PHP
   extensions
 - Encourages security best-practices and provides tools and examples to secure
   applications
 - Provides an easy to use and consistent API so that end-user code doesn't
   have to handle as many edge cases
 - Does not require manual definition of [/docs/ObjectRelationalMapping ORM]
   model schemas or relationships
 - Is not released in long monolithic release cycles
 - Doesn’t require using the developer’s favorite
   [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control revision control] software
   ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_(software) SVN],
   [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System CVS],
   [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software) GIT],
   [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazaar_(software) Bazaar], etc) to get the
   latest code
 - Allows removing extraneous code or downloading only what you want
 - Provides a simplified and consistent interface to common PHP usage patterns
 - Does not simply try to emulate another framework from another language
 - Is released under a minimally invasive open source license, to allow for
   inclusion in closed source code
