fUnexpectedException is a sub-class of fException meant to provide a common parent class for all exceptions that should '''''not''''' be expected or handled in the site/application code.

== Special Functionality ==

All classes that extend fUnexpectedException change the functionality of the `printMessage()` method. Instead of printing the exception message, a generic error message is printed. These classes are designed to be handled by the fCore::enableExceptionHandling() method, which intercepts all uncaught exceptions and delivers the backtrace via one of three methods (see the [/docs/fCore#ErrorExceptionHandling fCore class] for details).

== Child Classes ==

Below is a list of all child classes that extend fUnexpectedException. These classes are '''''not''''' documented using a ''Throws:'' entry in the API documentation since they should '''''not''''' be handled via normal site/application code.

|| '''Class'''             || '''Description''' ||
|| fConnectivityException  || This type of exception indicates some sort of connection error occured, whether it be with a database server, remote API, etc. ||
|| fEnvironmentException   || This type of exception indicates something is wrong with the server environment that is preventing proper execution of code. ||
|| fProgrammerException    || This type of exception indicates that the programming building the site/application wrote invalid code, or somehow otherwise violated an expected format or sequence. ||
|| fSQLException           || This type of exception indicates an error was returned when executing an SQL query. This will not be thrown in the situation where a query returns no results, but rather when SQL syntax is incorrect. ||
