The fSQLSchemaTranslation class is an internal class used by fSQLTranslation for translating [/docs/FlourishSql Flourish SQL] DDL statements, such as `ALTER TABLE` and `CREATE TABLE`, into the dialect of SQL supported by the current database. To take advantage of the features of this class, be sure to call [/api/fDatabase#translatedquery `translatedQuery()`] instead of [/api/fDatabase#query `query()`].

fSQLSchemaTranslation is separate from fSQLTranslation due to the sheer amount of code necessary to implement `ALTER TABLE` functionality that works consistently across databases. In addition, this functionality is not used as frequently as the DML statements supported by fSQLTranslation.
