= Contributor License Agreements =

In order for anyone other than myself to contribute ideas, code or
documentation to Flourish, I ask that they sign a contributor license
agreement (CLA). This document is used to define the terms under which
contributions to Flourish are made. They also could potentially be used in the
case of a law suit to help in defense.

Individuals contributing any code, documentation or ideas that they own the
rights to should sign the [/files/flourish_cla.pdf
Flourish Contributor License Agreement]. If you are submitting intellectual
property (IP) owned by your employer, they will need to sign the
[/files/flourish_ccla.pdf Flourish Corporate Contributor
License Agreement]. Please be aware that an individual who is covered under a
corporate CLA will also need to submit an individual CLA if they submit any IP
that is not owned by their employer.
