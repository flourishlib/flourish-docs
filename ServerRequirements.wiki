= Server Requirements =
<<toc>>

Whenever possible Flourish is coded to support any server with at least the
default extensions and PHP 5.1.0 or greater. Here is a list of the default
extensions used throughout the code:

 - [http://php.net/ctype ctype]
 - [http://php.net/iconv iconv]
 - [http://php.net/pcre pcre]
 - [http://php.net/session session]
 - [http://php.net/spl spl]

It is possible to disable these extensions when compiling PHP, so you will need
to ensure each is installed. The simplest way is to look at the output of a
script with the following contents:

{{{
#!php
<?php
phpinfo();
}}}

== Class Specific Requirements ==

Beyond the Flourish-wide requirements there are a few non-default security-
related extensions that are required for specific features. Below is a list of
classes/methods and what they require.

|| '''Classes/Methods'''                                                     || '''Extensions Required''' ||
|| fCrytography::publicKeyEncrypt(), fCryptography::publicKeyDecrypt()       || [http://php.net/openssl openssl] ||
|| fCrytography::publicKeySign(), fCryptography::publicKeyVerify()           || [http://php.net/openssl openssl] ||
|| fCrytography::symmetricKeyEncrypt(), fCryptography::symmetricKeyDecrypt() || [http://php.net/mcrypt mcrypt] ||
|| fEmail::sign(), fEmail::encrypt()                                         || [http://php.net/openssl openssl] ||
|| fSMTP::__construct() with the `$secure` flag                              || [http://php.net/openssl openssl] ||

== Extensions for Performance ==

A few of the Flourish classes provide pure PHP implementations of functionality
that is also available from extensions that are not installed by default. Below
is a list of the classes and the extension that will provide better performance.

|| '''Class'''    || '''Extension'''                                         ||
|| fJSON          || [http://php.net/json json] (included in 5.2 by default) ||
|| fNumber/fMoney || [http://php.net/bc bcmath]                              ||
|| fUTF8          || [http://php.net/mbstring mbstring]                      ||
