<<toc>>

Versioning happens on two different levels with Flourish. On the lowest level,
each class that is part of Flourish is versioned using a three-part number. On
the library level, Flourish is versioned using the current revision number of
the SVN repository.

== Class Versioning ==

All classes are versioned using a three-part number in the following format:

{{{
{major_version}.{minor_version}.{edit_version}
}}}

Below are some examples of valid version numbers:

{{{
1.0.0
1.0.25
1.5.1
1.0.0b
}}}

The last version, `1.0.0b` signifies that the class is currently in beta. This
type of version will only exist before version `1.0.0`, and will not be present
once Flourish [/docs/Roadmap hits stable].

The version number have the following significance:

 - '''Major version:''' this will only change when a major rearchitecting of a
   class happens, or when backwards compatibility breaks occur
 - '''Minor version:''' an increase to the minor version indicates that a new
   feature was added or an existing feature was enhanced
 - '''Edit version:''' this is the most common change to the version and
   indicates a bug was fixed or changes were made that did not affect
   functionality in any way

== Library Versioning ==

Flourish, as a library of related classes, is versioned simply by the current
revision of the master SVN repository.
