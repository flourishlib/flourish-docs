= Constructor Functions = 

Constructor functions are functions with the same name as Flourish instance
classes that accept the same parameters, and return a new object. Their only
purpose is to work around the fact that up until PHP 5.4, it was not possible
to chain method calls off of a constructor.

While the constructor functions used to be a manual add-on to Flourish, they
are now defined inside of fLoader and will be available when using fLoader
to load Flourish.
