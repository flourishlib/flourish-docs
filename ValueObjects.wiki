= Value Objects =

The term value object refers to a small object that contains a simple value such
as a dates, numbers, string or money. They are implemented to be immutable,
meaning a new object is created whenever modifications are requested. This
property helps to prevent the side affects that come from objects being passed
by reference.

There are five classes in Flourish that are implemented as value objects:

 - fDate
 - fMoney
 - fNumber
 - fTime
 - fTimestamp
